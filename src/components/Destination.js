//               One of the most iconic views in Luzon, Mt. Taal boasts a volcano
//               inside a lake inside an island. If you fancy a closer look, the
//               hike up to the crater is a mere 45 minutes, and is easy enough for
//               beginners. Guides will assist you most of the way, and youâ€™ll see
//               the peculiar environment found on an active volcano, including
//               volcanic rocks and steam vents. The hike can be dusty and hot, so
//               plan for an early morning trip, and then unwind with some bulalo
//               before heading back home!
